# mirrulations-search



## Dev Setup

* Create a virtual environment

  ```
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

* Install Dependencies

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

* Install source as a package named `mirrsearch`

  ```
  pip install -e .
  ```

  NOTE: `-e` means the package is editable



## Run the Flask Server

Because the code is in a module, you can run it with the `-m` switch:

```
python -m mirrsearch.app
```

If you are in `src/mirrsearch`, you can run `app.py` directly:

```
python app.py
```

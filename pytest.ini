# Suppress ResourceWarnings from the coverage tool's internal SQLite usage.
# The coverage plugin uses SQLite internally to track coverage data, and these
# connections are not always properly closed, causing ResourceWarnings. These
# warnings are not related to our test code - they come from the coverage tool
# itself. When running tests with --no-cov, no warnings appear, confirming
# that our code does not leak database connections.
